# UnitTestExample

In this project we have a simple abstraction of banking operations with savings, portfolio, withdrawal, deposit and investment list.

The focus is on unit tests, where we have (U) for testing component functionality and (I) for template. In particular we have an HTTP request test with mock substitution in services. The tests are located in the ‘.spec’ files. 

Below are the instructions to run the tests and the project.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
`ng test --code--coverage` To track test coverage.
